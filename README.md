This project is working on creating a virtual Dublin city with changing weather. Dublin, the capital city of Ireland, has a temperate maritime climate, which is characterized by mild winters, cool summers, and high precipitation throughout the year. The weather has some variations due to the influence of the North Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream. Rain is a common occurrence in Dublin throughout the year. Despite the rain, Dublin has a unique charm and beauty in wet weather, with colorful umbrellas and reflections on the cobbled streets creating a cozy and romantic atmosphere!

Dublinâ€™s weather is quite dynamic and unpredictable. This VR world would contain a Dublin city view with a very fancy sky, and the sky would change randomly. The VR world would also rain some time, and the intensity of the rain would also change randomly. As a visitor to our VR Dublin city, you can experience the unpredictable and dynamic weather and rain of Dublin. We also want to add some symbolic architecture or sculpture objects to let people know Dublin and the history. In addition to this, users would also be able to navigate to different places present in Dublin such as Christ Church and Spire etc. We would add some 3D objects to represent these places, and visitors would be able to click or touch these objects to get the introductions.
